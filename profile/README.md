# THE FUNKIN CREW INC

This is the Github page for The Funkin' Crew Inc.

If for some reason you don't know what Github is, it's where we are publishing the source code to things such as [our website funkin.me](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/funkBlog), and our main in-development project, [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/funkin).

If for some reason you don't know what Friday Night Funkin' is, you can play the demo on Newgrounds: [newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371)

Friday Night Funkin' is programmed in the [Haxe](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe) programming language, using open source technologies [Lime](https://github.com/openfl/lime), [OpenFL](https://github.com/openfl/openfl), and [HaxeFlixel](https://github.com/haxeflixel/flixel).

Open source is love, open source is life. We strongly love and appreciate open source, FOREVER.
